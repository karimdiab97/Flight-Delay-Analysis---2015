I'm excited to share my latest project: an in-depth analysis of 2015 flight delay data in the US, conducted in collaboration with ITI. By analyzing over 6 million flight records, I've unearthed valuable insights that can benefit both airlines and travelers.

## Key Questions Explored:
1. How do weekday and weekend flight statistics compare?
2. What are the monthly cancellation trends for JetBlue Airways?
3. How do delays vary by week, state, city, and airline?
4. Which airlines experience no departure/arrival delays within the 2500-3000 distance range?
5. What are the flight counts for each airline?
6. What are the quarterly trends in flight cancellations?
7. How are flight counts distributed among different delay types?
8. How does flight volume vary by month and day of the week?
9. What percentage of flights experienced departure delays in 2015, and what was the average delay time?
10. How does the percentage of delayed flights change throughout the year, particularly for flights departing from Boston (BOS)?
11. How many flights were cancelled in 2015, and what percentage were due to weather vs. airline/carrier issues?
12. Which airlines demonstrate the highest and lowest reliability in terms of on-time departures?

## Insights Revealed:
- In 2015, a total of 5,819,079 flights were recorded, with significant variation between weekend and weekday operations.
- JetBlue experienced its highest cancellations in June (55), with none in January.
- Southwest Airlines operated the most flights, while Virgin America had the fewest.
- Arrival and departure delays were prevalent, highlighting the need for improvement in minimizing these occurrences.
